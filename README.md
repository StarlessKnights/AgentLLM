# Agent LLM

An experiment in building a simple LLM Agent that is able to understand long-range questions and use sequential tools.

## About
It's a small project I had to build from scratch an AI agent that was able to take in arbitrary tasks and use them to solve problems. I've managed to make a system that means you could hypothetically add infinite tools to the agent and it would still be able to function.
